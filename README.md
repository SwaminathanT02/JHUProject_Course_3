**Contents**
The contents of the repository include(excluding README.md):
1. run_analysis.R : This program uses the dataset provided above to provide an ordered and tidy
                    single-file dataset using the existing data. It does the following operations:
                    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
                    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each                        measurement.
                    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
                    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
                    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set                         with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

2. TidyDataset.txt : Independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each                             activity and each subject.

3. CodeBook.md : Descriptions to the corresponding variables and the given data can be found here.
