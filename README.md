**Contents**
The contents of the repository include(excluding README.md):
1. _run_analysis.R_ : This program uses the dataset provided above to provide an ordered and tidy
                    single-file dataset using the existing data. It does the following operations:
                    * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
                    * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each                        measurement.
                    * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
                    * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
                    * From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set                         with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

2. _TidyDataset.txt_ : Independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each                             activity and each subject.

3. _CodeBook.md_ : Descriptions to the corresponding variables and the given data can be found here.
